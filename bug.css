The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For instance, mixing percentages and pixels without parentheses can lead to incorrect calculations.  Also, issues can arise with the use of `calc()` alongside other CSS properties like `transform` or `box-shadow` if calculations are not handled correctly.
