# CSS `calc()` Gotchas
This repository demonstrates some less common errors that can arise when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `bug.css` file shows examples of incorrect calculations due to operator precedence and unit mixing. `bugSolution.css` presents the corrected versions.

**Key Issues Addressed:**

* Incorrect order of operations in `calc()` expressions.
* Inconsistent use of units (e.g., mixing percentages and pixels).
* Unexpected behavior when using `calc()` with `transform` or `box-shadow`.

This repo serves as a learning resource to help developers write more robust and accurate CSS using the `calc()` function.
